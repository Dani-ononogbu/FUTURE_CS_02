**Security Alert Monitoring \& Incident Response (FUTURE\_CS\_02)**



&nbsp;Project Overview



This project demonstrates the monitoring, analysis, and response to simulated security alerts using a SIEM tool (Splunk). The task involved identifying suspicious activities, classifying incidents based on severity, and producing an incident response report aligned with SOC best practices.





 **Tools Used**



**Splunk Enterprise (SIEM)**



Sample SOC log files (provided by Future Intern)



Microsoft Word (Incident Report)



Microsoft Excel (Alert Classification Log)







 **Key Activities Performed**



Ingested and analyzed simulated security logs



Identified malware alerts, failed login attempts, and suspicious IP activity



Classified alerts by severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical)



Built an incident timeline and response analysis



Created SIEM dashboard visualizations







**Repository Structure**



**Incident\_Report/ –** Detailed incident response documentation



**Alert\_Classification\_Log/** – Excel-based alert triage log



**Screenshots/** – Evidence from Splunk searches



**Dashboard/** – SIEM dashboard visuals







Key Findings



Multiple malware detections (Trojan, Rootkit, Spyware) across internal and external IPs



Repeated failed login attempts from public IP addresses



Indicators of internal malware spread requiring urgent remediation







&nbsp;Outcome



This project simulates real-world SOC alert monitoring and incident handling, demonstrating skills in log analysis, alert triage, incident classification, and security reporting.
